  "summary": "Diff adds a custom tile-based map component (OpenStreetMap tiles) and wires it into the cafe search page with coordinated selection between list and map, plus UI changes to CafeCard to support selection and navigation. However, the diff summary does not show explicit removal of any prior Google Maps/unsupported map integration (if it existed).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Remove any Google Maps / unsupported map library integration so the frontend build succeeds without relying on Google Maps Platform or Google Maps JS SDK.",
      "reason": "The diff shows addition of a new tile-based map (OSM) but does not show deletion/removal of any existing Google Maps integration, imports, or dependencies. If Google Maps code existed previously, its removal is not evidenced here.",
